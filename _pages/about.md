My name is Ehsan Tadayon. I am a Neurology Resident at Tufts University. 

After graduating from medical school, I did a few years of postdoctoral research at Harvard Medical School where I started to notice an existing gap between our growing understanding of brain function and how we characterize, diagnose and treat neuropsychiatric disorders. 

This blog is an attempt to fill this gap.
