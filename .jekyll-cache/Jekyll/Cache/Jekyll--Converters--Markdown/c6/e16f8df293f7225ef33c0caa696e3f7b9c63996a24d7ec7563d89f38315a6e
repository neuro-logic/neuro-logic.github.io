I"›<p>My name is Ehsan Tadayon. I am a Neurology Resident at Tufts University.</p>

<p>After graduating from medical school, I did a few years of postdoctoral research at Harvard Medical School where I started to notice an existing gap between our growing understanding of brain function and how we characterize, diagnose and treat neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>This blog is an attempt to fill this gap.</p>
